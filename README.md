# Terminal Typing Tool / Tutor / Toy

## About
This is a simple typing utility similar to monkeytype or many online typing tests that allows you to practice typing within your terminal.
I wrote it as an exercise while learning Rust.

## Running
To run development / debug mode just run:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Building
To build a release run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Installing
To install the app, just copy built binary to some directory under path, for example:

```bash
sudo cp target/release/ttt /usr/local/bin/
```
